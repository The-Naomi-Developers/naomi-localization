management_config.description.warn_triggers: |-
  Warning triggers - is the ability to execute one of my many commands automatically when a member of the server has received a certain number of warnings
  You can use it, for example, to give a ban to those who have reached 5 warnings, but these warn-triggers are not limited to it

  **Examples of adding such triggers:**
  `{p}warn-triggers add 3 money set $target 0` - adds a trigger for 3 warnings. When the member reaches the 3 warnings, I will execute the command `{p}money set <current_member_here> 0` automatically. This example completely voids the balance of this member

  **Note:**
  The warn-triggers have the ability to use some variables, namely:
  `$target` - **mention** of the user who was warned
  `$channel` - **recall** of the current text channel

  The warn-trigger is executed on behalf of the moderator who gave the warning! Simply put, this means that if you have given a warning to someone and triggered a warn-trigger, the trigger command will be executed as if you had manually executed it

management_config.description.warn_triggers.add: |-
  Add a new warning trigger to the system

  **Examples:**
  `{p}warn-triggers add 3 money set $target 0` - adds a trigger for 3 warnings. When the member reaches the 3 warnings, I will execute the command `{p}money set <current_member_here> 0` automatically. This example completely voids the balance of this member
  `{p}warn-triggers add 10 ban $target Got 10 warnings.` - a more familiar example: after reaching 10 warnings, the server member will be banned from the server due to "Got 10 warnings."

  **Note:**
  The warn-triggers have the ability to use some variables, namely:
  `$target` - **mention** of the user who was warned
  `$channel` - **recall** of the current text channel

  The warn-trigger is executed on behalf of the moderator who gave the warning! Simply put, this means that if you have given a warning to someone and triggered a warn-trigger, the trigger command will be executed as if you had manually executed it

management_config.description.warn_triggers.remove: |-
  Delete the warning trigger linked to the specified number of warnings

  **Examples:**
  `{p}warn-triggers remove 3` - if there is a trigger linked to 3 warnings in the system, it will be removed. However, if there is no such trigger, the command will not generate a message about it. You can find out which triggers are in the system by executing the `{p}warn-triggers` command

  **Note:**
  The warn-trigger is executed on behalf of the moderator who gave the warning! Simply put, this means that if you have given a warning to someone and triggered a warn-trigger, the trigger command will be executed as if you had manually executed it
